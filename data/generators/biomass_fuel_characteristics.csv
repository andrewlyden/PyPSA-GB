# Notes:
# - marginal_costs in £/MWh (fuel + O&M)
# - efficiency as fraction (0-1)
# - committable TRUE = can be scheduled on/off; FALSE = always on (baseload)
# - p_min_pu as percentage (e.g. 40 = 40% minimum stable generation)
# - ramp_limit_up/down as fraction per hour (0.1 = 10% per hour)
# - emissions_factor in tCO2/MWh (biomass/biogas = 0 biogenic, EfW = 0.15 fossil fraction, geothermal = 0)
# - min_up_time/min_down_time in hours (geothermal = 0, operates continuously)
# - start_up_cost in £ (geothermal = 0, no start-up)
# Geothermal: Low O&M costs, high efficiency, baseload operation, ~85% availability
