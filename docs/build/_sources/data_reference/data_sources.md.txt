## NESO Future Energy Scenarios (FES)

The primary source for future capacity projections.

### Overview

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Publisher** | NESO (formerly National Grid ESO) |
| **Frequency** | Annual (typically July) |
| **Coverage** | GB electricity system 2025-2050 |
| **Granularity** | Technology × GSP × Year |
| **Access** | Open API + Excel files |
| **Available Releases** | FES 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025 |

### FES Releases and Scenarios

NESO publishes updated FES reports annually. You can model any FES release to compare how projections evolve.

### Data Fields

FES provides capacity by:
- **Technology**: Wind, Solar, Nuclear, CCGT, etc.
- **Technology Detail**: Offshore Wind, Onshore Wind, etc.
- **GSP**: Grid Supply Point (connection location)
- **Year**: 2025-2050

### Location

```
data/FES/
├── FES_api_urls.yaml          # API endpoints
├── FES_2024_*.xlsx            # Raw Excel downloads
└── gsp_boundaries/            # GSP geographic data
```

### Usage in Model

```python
# Processed FES data - example for 2024 release
resources/FES/FES_2024_data.csv
```

When configuring a scenario in `config/scenarios.yaml`, specify both the FES release year and the pathway name:

```yaml
HT35:
  modelled_year: 2035
  FES_year: 2024              # Which FES release to use
  FES_scenario: "Holistic Transition"  # Which pathway within that release
```

For future years (`modelled_year > 2024`), PyPSA-GB uses the specified FES release to provide:
- Thermal generation capacity
- Renewable capacity by technology
- Storage capacity (GSP-level)
- Demand projections

**Note**: Different FES releases may have different scenario names and capacity values for the same modelled year. Use this to explore sensitivity to FES updates.

## ERA5 Weather Data

Reanalysis weather data for renewable generation profiles.

| **Publisher** | ECMWF / Copernicus |
| **Frequency** | Hourly |
| **Coverage** | Global (subset for GB) |
| **Granularity** | ~30km grid |

### Variables Used

- 100m wind speed (for wind power)
- 10m wind speed
- Surface solar radiation
- Temperature (for PV efficiency)
- Runoff (for hydro)

### Location

```
resources/atlite/cutouts/
├── uk-2019.nc                 # Weather cutout for 2019
├── uk-2020.nc
├── uk-2021.nc
└── ...
```

### Acquisition Strategy

PyPSA-GB uses a **tiered acquisition strategy** for weather cutouts:

1. **Data directory** - Check `data/atlite/cutouts/` for cached files
2. **Zenodo** - Download pre-built cutouts (~5-10 minutes per year)
3. **ERA5 API** - Generate from scratch via atlite (~2-4 hours per year)

#### Quick Start (Years 2010-2024)

For years 2010-2024, cutouts are automatically downloaded from Zenodo:

```bash
# Configure desired years in config/cutouts_config.yaml
snakemake -s Snakefile_cutouts --cores 1
```

**No CDS API credentials required** for these years!

#### Custom Years (Outside 2010-2024)

For other years, you'll need CDS API credentials:

```bash
# 1. Register at: https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/user/register
# 2. Set up ~/.cdsapirc with your API key
# 3. Generate cutout
snakemake -s Snakefile_cutouts --cores 1
```

### Pre-built Cutouts (Zenodo)

Pre-built cutouts for years 2010-2024 are available on Zenodo:

- **Repository**: [PyPSA-GB Atlite Cutouts](https://zenodo.org/records/18325225)
- **License**: CC-BY-4.0
- **File size**: ~765 MB per year
- **Download time**: 5-10 minutes per year
- **MD5 verification**: Automatic

These cutouts are automatically used by the workflow and require no manual intervention.

## Data Quality Notes

### Known Issues

| Source | Issue | Mitigation |
|--------|-------|------------|
| DUKES | Missing coordinates for some stations | Manual geocoding |
| REPD | Duplicate entries | Deduplication script |
| ETYS | Some circuits under construction | Filter by status |
| FES | GSP names change between years | Mapping tables |

### Validation

The model validates data during build:

```bash
python scripts/validate_scenarios.py
```

This checks:
- All generators have valid coordinates
- Capacity totals match expected values
- No orphan buses in network
