PyPSA-GB: An open source model of the GB power system for simulating future energy scenarios
============================================================================================

PyPSA-GB is an open dataset and power dispatch model of the GB transmission network using country-specific data over historical years and National Grid's Future Energy Scenarios for future years. 

Two aspects of the GB electricity market can be readily modelled: (i) the wholesale electricity market, by solving a single bus unit commitment optimisation problem to dispatch generators and storage, and (ii) the balancing mechanism, by solving a network constrained linear optimal power flow.

National Grid's Future Energy Scenarios (Steady Progression, System Transformation, Consumer Transformation, and Leading The Way) can be simulated for the years 2021 to 2050. This requires the choice of a baseline year for weather data and demand, and this can be chosen for 2010-2020. The historical years 2010-2020 can also be simulated. Simulations can be carried out in half-hourly or hourly timesteps.

Assumptions made in the model are transparent and can be modified directly through the appropriate data files. It is the intention of the developers that this model and dataset can provide a foundation for active development and improvement. The 'Issues' section on the GitHub page contains suggestions for improvements. Contributions are welcomed and encouraged.
